				<h3 style="font-size: 3vw">First, What is Sociology?</h3>
				<p>Sociology is a multifaceted field that investigates social life, change, and the causes and effects of human behavior. It encompasses the study of groups, societies, and organizations and explores how people interact within these contexts. Sociology is broad in scope and encompasses everything from organized crime to religious cults and from the sociology of work to the sociology of sports. It provides distinct perspectives on the world and is capable of generating new ideas while critiquing the old. The field is rapidly expanding and has increasing relevance in crafting policies and programs.</p>

				<h3 style="font-size: 3vw">What does Sociology have to do with Modern Technology?</h3>
				<p>Sociology and modern technology are closely linked in today's world. Technology is a big part of our lives, affecting how we act, connect with others, and how society is organized. Sociologists study how technology impacts our social interactions, communication, and power structures. They explore things like the digital divide, social media, online communities, privacy, surveillance, and ethical concerns with new technologies. By looking at these connections, sociology helps us understand how society and technology influence each other.</p>

				<h3 style="font-size: 3vw">What are the impacts of technology to society?</h3>
				<p>Technology has a profound effect on society, touching every aspect of our lives. It has completely changed the way we communicate, connecting us instantly across the globe through platforms like social media. It has transformed industries, bringing automation, boosting productivity, and creating new job opportunities, but also causing disruptions and displacing some workers. Education and healthcare have greatly benefited from technology, making knowledge more accessible and improving medical treatments. However, we must address concerns about privacy, security, and the unequal access to technology. Ultimately, technology shapes our behavior, relationships, economy, and the very essence of how we live.</p>

				<p>Sociology in technology is about studying how technology impacts society. It helps us understand how technology affects the way people interact, communicate, and have power. It shows us the good things that technology brings, like connecting people and giving access to information. But some people say that sociology can be too focused on theory and not practical enough when it comes to developing technology. They think it focuses too much on the negative effects of technology. However, overall, sociology is important because it helps us think about how to use technology in a responsible and fair way that benefits everyone.</p>
